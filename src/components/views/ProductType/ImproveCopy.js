      <p>
        One specific tip for you to improve as a product leader is to start
        getting results.
        <br />
        <br />
        Usually, that means actually executing on strategy to move the business
        - and product teams - forward.
        <br />
        <br />
        How?
        <br />
        <br />
        We use a framework called the MVO. The "Minimal Viable Offer".
        <br />
        <br />
        By defining one clear offer for your target customer, then pitching it
        to them with a personal outreach campaign & simple landing page, you can
        rapidly validate whether your product strategy makes sense.
        <br />
        <br />
        Specifically, that means:
        <br />
        <br />
        1. Define one unique insight that drives your product (why people engage
        with your product, not other products)
        <br />
        <br />
        2. Craft an MVO statement stating your promise to your target customer
        (use this format if you are stuck:{' '}
        <i>
          "We help [INSERT NICHE] achieve [INSERT DESIRED OUTCOME] with [YOUR
          CONCRETE OFFER]" e.g. "We fast-track frustrated PMs to Head of Product
          with a 6-week by getting you to build a product from scratch"
        </i>
        )
        <br />
        <br />
        3. Create a simple landing page with your MVO as the header, a short
        line underneath explaining how you deliver on your promise specifically,
        then an email signup to "Join the Waiting List" (see{' '}
        <a href="https://prod.mba">our website</a> as an example)
        <br />
        <br />
        If you get 5-10% of those you contacting signing up, it shows that they
        have an intent to engage with your offer and that it is worth exploring
        this strategy further.

      <p>
        One specific tip for you to improve as a product leader is to focus on
        the <i>why</i> behind what you are building, not just the <i>what</i>.
        <br />
        <br />
        Mastery comes through experience. Experience comes through repetition.
        <br />
        <br />
        Therefore, we suggest doing this exercise 5 times:
        <br />
        <br />
        1) Define a specific user persona that you feel is under-served
        <br />
        <br />
        2) Define what they ultimately desire (not a solution, but some sort of
        personal transformation, such as greater wealth or sense of self-worth)
        <br />
        <br />
        3) Define why you believe they are being under-served by current
        solutions in the market
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        By repeating this exercise, you will start thinking more strategically
        about what it is your product - or a new product you develop - should
        offer.
        <br />
        <br />
        At Prod MBA, we teach students to use this process - once validated with
        your user persona - to craft a compelling product strategy & better
        direct your team & organisation.

      <p>
        One specific tip for you to get very good at is discovering the "one
        decision that removes a thousand future decisions"
        <br />
        <br />
        That comes from focusing on action, not just influence.
        <br />
        <br />
        How specifically?
        <br />
        <br />
        It comes down to being able to run effective workshops, in our
        experience. To move a disparate group of stakeholders from a mass of
        problems and ideas towards a coherent, strategic solution.
        <br />
        <br />
        We teach our students to use the "Lightning Decision Jam" format, which
        takes 1hr to move from any mass of problems to solution in 60 minutes,
        as it's extremely adaptable & delivers results.
        <br />
        <br />
        Combine this with a Miro board for visual collaboration, and you will
        realise the power of this format to improve the speed & quality of your
        organisation's decisions.

    tip: (
      <p>
        Most aspiring product leaders are good at speaking to customers - or
        running user tests - on a feature level.
        <br />
        <br />
        Very few, however, understand how to leverage customer insight on a
        vision, strategy & roadmap level.
        <br />
        <br />
        That's where the MVO cones in. The "Minimal Viable Offer".
        <br />
        <br />
        By defining one clear offer for your target customer, then pitching it
        to them with a personal outreach campaign & simple landing page, you can
        rapidly validate a product vision & strategy in under 5 days.
        <br />
        <br />
        Specifically, that means:
        <br />
        <br />
        1. Define one unique insight that you <i>assume</i> drives your product
        (why people engage with your product, not other products)
        <br />
        <br />
        2. Craft an MVO statement stating your promise to your target customer
        (use this format if you are stuck:{' '}
        <i>
          "We help [INSERT NICHE] achieve [INSERT DESIRED OUTCOME] with [YOUR
          CONCRETE OFFER]" e.g. "We fast-track frustrated PMs to Head of Product
          with a 6-week by getting you to build a product from scratch"
        </i>
        )
        <br />
        <br />
        3. Create a simple landing page with your MVO as the header, a short
        line underneath explaining how you deliver on your promise specifically,
        then an email signup to "Join the Waiting List" (see{' '}
        <a href="https://prod.mba">our website</a> as an example). If you get
        5-10% of those you contacting signing up, it shows that they have an
        intent to engage with your offer and that it is worth exploring this
        strategy further.
        <br />
        <br />
        4. Validate your assumptions through an open-ended user interview
        exploring their problem & any past actions they have taken to try to
        solve it

    tip: (
      <p>
        It's good to have good general skills in product, as it touches upon
        every aspect of a business.
        <br />
        <br />
        However, the thing that really moves the needle is being very strategic:
        Understanding precisely which problems to pursue & where the
        opportunities are in the market.
        <br />
        <br />
        This is particularly true now, as it has become so easy to launch new
        products (think of the plethora of landing page & no-code prototyping
        tools).
        <br />
        <br />
        Do this exercise 5 times to start building a habit of thinking
        strategically:
        <br />
        <br />
        1) Define a specific user persona that you feel is under-served
        <br />
        <br />
        2) Define what they ultimately desire (not a solution, but some sort of
        personal transformation, such as greater wealth or sense of self-worth)
        <br />
        <br />
        3) Define why you believe they are being under-served by current
        solutions in the market
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        By repeating this exercise, you will start thinking more strategically
        about what it is your product - or a new product you develop - should
        offer.
        <br />
        <br />
        At Prod MBA, we teach students to use this process - once validated with

    tip: (
      <p>
        You're likely just getting started, so it wouldn't be helpful to give
        specific advice.
        <br />
        <br />
        The one thing that will really accelerate your learning, however, is
        simply putting ideas into practice.
        <br />
        <br />
        If you've read about product strategy, define & validate one as a side
        project with a specific user persona you can think of (really, anyone
        with a problem that needs solving).
        <br />
        <br />
        If you're frustrated with pointless meetings, go & read online about how
        to run effective meetings, then use that format in your next
        retrospective or team meeting.
        <br />
        <br />
        If you want to get better at understanding customers, go & speak to
        them! Don't just busy yourself with managing tickets & technical or
        feasibility issues.
        <br />
        <br />
        Action, initiative, persistance. These are the traits that separate good
        from great product leaders.
